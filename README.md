Build a machine learning model to classify whether a customer will default on a loan (default = 1) or not (default = 0).

Our Random Forest model outperforms both Decision Tree and Logistic Regression, achieving:
✅ Higher accuracy (79.86%)
✅ Strong sensitivity (92.23%) → Great at catching defaulters
✅ Balanced accuracy of 68.34% → Better than before
